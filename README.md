Web design samples and experiments

working
=======

todo
====
- responsive font strategy

bugs
====
- make page load faster (see http://tools.pingdom.com/) Reduce .gif size without reducing quality (page load speed)
- why is footer not sticky on iPhone and iPad? add @media or iPad and iPhone?
- image height too tall on iPhone, add @media to handle with different approach for device?
- why is font doubled on iPad/safari?

new layouts
===========
- wide screen: photos on top, text below
- tablet landscape: same as above
- tablet portrait: photos vertical on left, text on right
- mobile: one photo and text, (footer TBD)

done
====
- fix sticky footer
- update urls in footer to be specific articles referenced
- made background (palms.jpg) smaller to improve load time
